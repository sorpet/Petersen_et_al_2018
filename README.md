Data and scripts connected to the publication `Modular 5′-UTR hexamers for context-independent tuning of protein expression in eukaryotes`. All figure panels that are not photographs, screenshots or drawings were created in R and can be reproduced using the scripts from this repository. The figure panels were combined into complete figures using Adobe illustrator.
