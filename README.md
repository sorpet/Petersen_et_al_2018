Data and scripts connected to the publication [Modular 5â€²-UTR hexamers for context-independent tuning of protein expression in eukaryotes](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky734). All figure panels that are not photographs, screenshots or drawings were created in R and can be reproduced using the scripts from this repository. The figure panels were combined into complete figures using Adobe illustrator.
